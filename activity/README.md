# Style a Resume: Apprentice
For this activity, you'll need to add some style rules to style.css in order to make the resume presentable.

At this level, there is no mock up, as the only expectation is to have a resume that is prettier than the original. While "prettier" is subjective, the bar is also set pretty low. 

Here are a few changes you may consider:
- change the font family used for various elements
- consider using a different font color for headings and 
  body text
- change the alignment of various elements (such as
  centering the title)
- add borders, padding, and margin to improve separation   of various parts of the resume
